# Supermarket--sales--analysis
I undertook a comprehensive supermarket sales analysis project utilizing
Python and data science techniques, showcasing my proficiency in both
domains. I derived valuable insights into customer behavior and product trends
by extracting, cleaning, and transforming data using Pandas. Employing
visualization libraries like Matplotlib, I effectively communicated findings to
stakeholders, facilitating informed decisions.
